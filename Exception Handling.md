# Exception Handling

Exceptions are a mechanism used by many programming languages to describe what to do when something unexpected happens.

Typically, something unexpected is an error of some sort, for example when a method is invoked with unacceptable arguments, or a network connection fails, or the use asks to open a non-existent file.

## What is an Exception

- A Java exception is an object that describes an exceptional (that is, error) condition that has occurred in a piece of code.
- When an exceptional condition arises, an object representing that exception is created and thrown in the method that caused the error.
- That method may choose to handle the exception itself or pass it on.
- Either way, at some point, the exception is caught and processed.
- Exceptions can be generated by the Java run-time system, or they can be manually generated by your code.
- Java exception handling is managed via five keywords: try, catch, throw, throws, and finally.

### The Consequences of an Uncaught Exception

Technically, any thrown exceptions must be handled some where within the program. Any exception that is not caught by your program will ultimately be processed by the default handler. The default handler displays a string describing the exception, prints a stack trace from the point at which the exception occurred, and terminates the program.

## Exception Class Hierarchy

All exception and error types are subclasses of the class Throwable, which is the base class of the hierarchy. One branch is headed by Exception. This class is used for exceptional conditions that user programs should catch. NullPointerException is an example of such an exception. Another branch, Error is used by the Java run-time system(JVM) to indicate errors having to do with the run-time environment itself(JRE). StackOverflowError is an example of such an error.

### Types of Exceptions

Java defines several types of exceptions that relate to its various class libraries. Java also allows users to define their own exceptions.
