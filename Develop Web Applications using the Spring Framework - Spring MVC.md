# Develop Web Applications using the Spring Framework - Spring MVC

Reference: (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc.html)

Spring Web MVC is the original web framework built on the Servlet API and has been included in the Spring Framework from the very beginning. The formal name, "Spring Web MVC," comes from the name of its source module (spring-webmvc), but it is more commonly known as "Spring MVC".
